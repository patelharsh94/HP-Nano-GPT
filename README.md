# HP-Nano-GPT
A basic Chat GPT implementation from scratch.

This project follows the following video from Andrej Karpathy:

This is an attempt to learn the transformer architecture and build myself a base version of Chat GPT that has been trained on the works of William Shakespear.

Training data can be found here:

## Results:
I decided to run the code on Google Colab using the T4 GPU runtime to make the training step move faster
the results are in Hp_Nano_Gpt_Run.ipynb file.
